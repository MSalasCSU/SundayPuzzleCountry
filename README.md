20210711 - Sunday Puzzle Challenge

Time to play the Puzzle! From NPR's Sunday Puzzle: "This week's challenge comes from listener Peter Collins, of Ann Arbor, Mich. Think of a country. Embedded in consecutive letters is a well-known brand name. The first, second, eighth and ninth letters of the country, in order, spell a former competitor of that brand. Name the country and the brands."

After reading a comprehensive list of countries, the first, second, eighth and ninth letters of the country as well as the country name will be printed to the console. See if you can solve the puzzle by finding a Brand in column one and another like-Brand spelled out consecutively in the country name.
